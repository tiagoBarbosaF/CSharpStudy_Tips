# CSharp Studies - Tips and Tricks!

> **Note:** Many blocks of code in the README file are in the Program.cs file where you can test at runtime.

## Syntax CSharp

### Console Application example => Program.cs

**Example:**

```C#
using System;

namespace CSharpStudy
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
        }
    }
}
```
1. `using System;` means that we can use classes from the `System` namespace
2. `namespace` is a used to organize your code, and it's a container for Classes and other namespaces"
3. `class` is a container for data and methods, which brings functionality to your program. Every line of code that tuns in C# must be inside a class. In this example our class have a name Program
4. `static void Main(string[] args)` this line code represent where our Program initialize

> **Note:** Every C# statement ends with a semicolon
